    <h1>Spatial Web Shooter – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</p>

    <p>Spatial Web Shooter is a single-player mixed reality game developed by Jingzhou Chen for Meta Quest headsets (Quest 2, Quest Pro, Quest 3, and Quest 3S). We take your privacy seriously. This privacy policy explains how Spatial Web Shooter handles information. In summary, the game works entirely offline and does not collect any personal or sensitive data from users.</p>

    <h2>Offline Play &amp; Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Spatial Web Shooter is designed to be played offline without any internet connection. The game does not require and does not use any internet connectivity. Because of this, the app does not collect, record, transmit, or share any personal information. Specifically, Spatial Web Shooter does <strong>not</strong> collect the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal identifiers (such as name, email address, phone number, or any contact information)</li>
      <li>Financial or payment information</li>
      <li>Precise location data or environmental mapping data</li>
      <li>Biometric or health data</li>
      <li>Camera images or video recordings of your environment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since the game collects no personal data, there is nothing to sell or share with anyone. Spatial Web Shooter is purely a self-contained application that prioritizes user privacy.</p>

    <h2>Local Game Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The only data that Spatial Web Shooter saves is basic gameplay information, such as your local high score and collectible counts. All gameplay data is stored <em>locally</em> on your device and never sent anywhere. There are no online leaderboards, cloud backups, or external servers used by the game. If you choose to uninstall Spatial Web Shooter from your device, all of this local data will be permanently deleted. Reinstalling the app will start the game fresh without any previous scores or progress, since no backups are maintained.</p>

    <h2>Mixed Reality Features</h2>
    <p>Spatial Web Shooter uses Meta Quest’s passthrough cameras and hand tracking to support its mixed reality (MR) experience. These features are used solely to enhance gameplay. The app <strong>cannot</strong> capture, store, or transmit any camera images or videos of your physical environment. All processing of passthrough visuals and hand tracking data is done on-device in real time for gameplay purposes. No imagery, 3D scans, or detailed environmental data are saved or shared.</p>

    <h2>No Third-Party Services or Ads</h2>
    <p>Spatial Web Shooter does not include any advertising SDKs, analytics tools, or social features. The game is built using the Unity engine, but no Unity Ads, Unity Analytics, or Unity cloud services have been intentionally enabled. The game operates entirely offline and does not transmit any data to Unity or other third parties. While we do not use online services, you can refer to Unity’s privacy policy for more information about their practices: <a href="https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy" target="_blank">https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Spatial Web Shooter is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from users under 13. Since the game collects no personal data, no child’s information is stored or tracked.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>All data created by Spatial Web Shooter is stored locally on your device. Uninstalling the game from your Meta Quest headset will remove all saved scores and game data. There are no online backups or cloud saves for the game. Once the app is deleted, no residual game data remains on any server or anywhere else.</p>
